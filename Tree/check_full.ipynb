    "# Full Binary Search Tree: The Perfect Family Branches Story ðŸŒ³\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes a Tree \"Full\"?\n",
    "Simple Rule:\n",
    "- Every node must have 0 or 2 children\n",
    "- No single children allowed!\n",
    "- Like parents either have no kids or exactly two kids\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Examples\n",
    "```\n",
    "Full Tree (Perfect!):\n",
    "      4\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "   2     6\n",
    "  / \\   / \\\n",
    " 1   3 5   7\n",
    "\n",
    "Also Full (Smaller but Perfect):\n",
    "      4\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "   2     6\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Full (Has Single Child):\n",
    "      4\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "   2     6\n",
    "    \\   \n",
    "     3   \n",
    "```\n",
    "## How to Check if Tree is Full\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Node Count Method\n",
    "1. Count total nodes (N)\n",
    "2. Count the height of the tree (h)\n",
    "3. Check if N = 2^h - 1\n",
    "  - Like checking if each parent has two kids!\n",
    "\n",
    "  This formula works because, the definition of a full binary tree is that every level is fully filled \n",
    "  with nodes. This means,\n",
    "```\n",
    "  level 0 = 2 ^ 0 = 1\n",
    "  level 1 = 2 ^ 1 = 2\n",
    "  level 2 = 2 ^ 2 = 4\n",
    "  level 3 = 2 ^ 3 = 8\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "\n",
    "  The sum of powers of 2 in geometric series 1 + r + r ^ 2 + ... + r ^ n - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  = r^n - 1 / r - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  for our case, r = 2, os\n",
    "\n",
    "  2^h - 1 / 2 - 1 = 2^h - 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Method 2: Recursive Check\n",
    "For each node:\n",
    "1. If leaf â†’ OK!\n",
    "2. If internal â†’ MUST have two children\n",
    "3. If one child â†’ NOT full!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Check Process\n",
    "```\n",
    "Check this tree:\n",
    "      4\n",
    "    /   \\\n",
    "   2     6\n",
    "  / \\   / \\\n",
    " 1   3 5   7\n",
    "```\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Check 4: Has 2 children âœ“\n",
    "2. Check 2: Has 2 children âœ“\n",
    "3. Check 6: Has 2 children âœ“\n",
    "4. Check 1: No children âœ“\n",
    "5. Check 3: No children âœ“\n",
    "6. Check 5: No children âœ“\n",
    "7. Check 7: No children âœ“\n",
    "Result: Full Tree! âœ¨\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Properties of Full BST\n",
    "1. Leaf Level:\n",
    "  - All leaves at same or adjacent levels\n",
    "  - Like cousins being close in age\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Node Count:\n",
    "  - Always odd number\n",
    "  - Perfect for balanced structure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Internal Nodes:\n",
    "  - Always have exactly two children\n",
    "  - No single-child parents!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "1. Confusing Full vs Complete:\n",
    "  - Full: All nodes have 0 or 2 kids\n",
    "  - Complete: Filled left to right\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Missing Single Child Check:\n",
    "  - One child = NOT full\n",
    "  - Must check every node\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Like a family where each parent must have either no kids or exactly two - no single child families allowed! ðŸŒ³"
