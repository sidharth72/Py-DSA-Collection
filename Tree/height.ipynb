    "# üå≤ Understanding Binary Search Tree Height: The Tree Climbing Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìè What is Tree Height?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a BST like a family tree turned upside down, where:\n",
    "* The Height = The longest path from root to any leaf\n",
    "* Each level represents one generation down\n",
    "* Empty tree has height = -1 (some implementations use 0)\n",
    "* Tree with only root has height = 0 (some implementations use 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ The Climbing Game Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a squirrel climbing this tree:\n",
    "* Starting from any node, you can climb down left or right\n",
    "* Your goal: Find the longest possible path to a leaf\n",
    "* Each step down = +1 to your path length\n",
    "* The longest path you find = Height of the subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Height Calculation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Rules:\n",
    "1. Leaf Node Height = 0\n",
    "2. Empty Node Height = -1\n",
    "3. Internal Node Height = max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Formula Behind It:\n",
    "* For any node N:\n",
    "    * height(N) = max(height(N.left), height(N.right)) + 1\n",
    "    * If N is null, height(N) = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Different Tree Shapes & Heights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Binary Tree:\n",
    "* Every internal node has exactly 2 children\n",
    "* All leaves are at the same level\n",
    "* Height = log‚ÇÇ(n + 1) - 1\n",
    "* Number of nodes = 2^(h + 1) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Example shape:\n",
    "       10\n",
    "     /    \\\n",
    "    5      15\n",
    "   / \\    /  \\\n",
    "  3   7  12   18\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewed Binary Tree:\n",
    "* Every node has only one child\n",
    "* Looks like a linked list\n",
    "* Height = n - 1 (where n is number of nodes)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example shape:\n",
    "       10\n",
    "        \\\n",
    "         15\n",
    "          \\\n",
    "           18\n",
    "            \\\n",
    "             20\n",
    "\n",
    "### Balanced BST:\n",
    "* Height difference between left and right subtrees ‚â§ 1\n",
    "* Height ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(n)\n",
    "* Example shape:\n",
    "       10\n",
    "     /    \\\n",
    "    5      15\n",
    "   /         \\\n",
    "  3           18\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "## üéØ Why Height Matters?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Performance Indicator:\n",
    "   * Lower height = Better performance\n",
    "   * Affects all operations (search, insert, delete)\n",
    "   * Optimal height = log‚ÇÇ(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Balancing Decisions:\n",
    "   * Height differences help detect imbalance\n",
    "   * Triggers rotations in self-balancing trees\n",
    "   * Keeps operations efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Space Complexity:\n",
    "   * Height = Maximum stack depth\n",
    "   * Affects memory usage in recursion\n",
    "   * Important for system resource planning\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Height Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Minimum Height:\n",
    "   * ‚åälog‚ÇÇ(n)‚åã\n",
    "   * Achieved in complete/perfect binary trees\n",
    "   * Best case scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maximum Height:\n",
    "   * n - 1 (where n is number of nodes)\n",
    "   * Occurs in skewed trees\n",
    "   * Worst case scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Average Height:\n",
    "   * O(log n) for randomly built BST\n",
    "   * Assumes random insertion order\n",
    "   * Most practical scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéÆ Height-Related Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Height Balancing:\n",
    "   * AVL Trees: |leftHeight - rightHeight| ‚â§ 1\n",
    "   * Red-Black Trees: Black height must be equal\n",
    "   * Used to maintain O(log n) operations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Level Operations:\n",
    "   * Level = Height from root (root is level 0)\n",
    "   * Width = Nodes at a specific level\n",
    "   * Important for level-order traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Depth vs Height:\n",
    "   * Depth = Path length from root to node\n",
    "   * Height = Longest path from node to leaf\n",
    "   * Height(root) = Maximum depth in tree\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Practical Applications\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Network Routing:\n",
    "   * Path length calculations\n",
    "   * Network topology optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Height Calculation:\n",
    "   * Forgetting to handle null nodes\n",
    "   * Incorrect base cases\n",
    "   * Not adding +1 for current node\n",

    "1. Regular Height Monitoring:\n",
    "   * Check during insertions/deletions\n",
    "   * Maintain balance proactively\n",
