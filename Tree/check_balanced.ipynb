    "# Balancing Binary Search Trees: Keeping the Family Harmony ðŸŽ¨\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Balanced BSTs\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree (BST) is considered balanced when:\n",
    "- The heights of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1\n",
    "- This ensures the tree is roughly \"symmetrical\"\n",
    "- Like a well-organized family tree where no branch is significantly taller than others\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Balance Matters\n",
    "1. Search Efficiency:\n",
    "  - Balanced BST => O(log n) search time\n",
    "  - Skewed BST => O(n) search time (worst case)\n",
    "  - Like finding someone quickly in a neat family tree vs a haphazard one\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space Efficiency:\n",
    "  - Balanced BST => Minimal wasted space\n",
    "  - Skewed BST => One side heavily loaded\n",
    "  - Imagine a lopsided family tree taking up unnecessary space\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking for Balance\n",
    "To determine if a BST is balanced, we can calculate the **height difference** between the left and right subtrees for each node. If the absolute difference is greater than 1 at any node, the tree is considered unbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are:\n",
    "1. Define a helper function that calculates the height of a subtree\n",
    "2. Recursively traverse the tree, calculating the height difference at each node\n",
    "3. Return true if all height differences are less than or equal to 1, false otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "The height calculation function:\n",
    "- For a null node, the height is 0\n",
    "- For a non-null node, the height is 1 + the maximum height of its left and right subtrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance checking function:\n",
    "- If the current node is null, return true (base case)\n",
    "- Calculate the height difference between the left and right subtrees\n",
    "- If the difference is greater than 1, return false (tree is unbalanced)\n",
    "- Recursively check the left and right subtrees, returning true only if both are balanced\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Walkthrough\n",
    "Consider the following BST:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "       8\n",
    "      / \\\n",
    "     3  10\n",
    "    / \\   \\\n",
    "   1   6   14\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Calculate heights:\n",
    "  - Height of 8's left subtree = 2\n",
    "  - Height of 8's right subtree = 2\n",
    "  - Height difference = |2 - 2| = 0 (balanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate heights:\n",
    "  - Height of 3's left subtree = 1 \n",
    "  - Height of 3's right subtree = 1\n",
    "  - Height difference = |1 - 1| = 0 (balanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate heights:\n",
    "  - Height of 6's left subtree = 0\n",
    "  - Height of 6's right subtree = 0 \n",
    "  - Height difference = |0 - 0| = 0 (balanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all height differences are less than or equal to 1, this BST is considered balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Balancing Unbalanced Trees\n",
    "If a BST is determined to be unbalanced, we can perform **tree rotations** to restore the balance. This involves restructuring the tree to reduce the height difference between subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main rotation types are:\n",
    "1. **Left Rotation**: Performed when the right subtree is taller than the left\n",
    "2. **Right Rotation**: Performed when the left subtree is taller than the right\n",
    "\n",
    "These rotations can be combined (left-right, right-left) to handle more complex imbalances.\n",
    "\n",
    "By continuously applying these rotations, we can transform an unbalanced BST into a balanced one, ensuring optimal search performance and space efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like keeping a family tree well-organized and symmetrical, maintaining a balanced BST is crucial for efficient data storage and retrieval! ðŸŽ¨"
