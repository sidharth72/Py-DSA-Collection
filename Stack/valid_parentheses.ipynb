    "# Valid Parentheses: A Stack Story üé≠\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Theater Seat Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you're working at a theater where couples must enter and exit together. Each '(' is someone entering, and each ')' is someone leaving. Your job? Make sure everyone who entered has left with their partner!\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Theater Rules Work\n",
    "- When someone enters '(' ‚Üí They get a seat (pushed to stack)\n",
    "- When someone exits ')' ‚Üí They must match with the last person who entered\n",
    "- At the end of the show ‚Üí All seats must be empty!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process Explained\n",
    "1. The Entry-Exit Rules:\n",
    "  - See '(' ‚Üí Person waits in seat (push to stack)\n",
    "  - See ')' ‚Üí Check if matches with last seated person (pop from stack)\n",
    "  - If mismatch ‚Üí We have a problem! (Invalid)\n",
    "  - If no one seated but someone exits ‚Üí Problem! (Invalid)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perfect Scenarios (Valid Cases):\n",
    "  - \"()\" ‚Üí One couple: enters, exits ‚úÖ\n",
    "  - \"(())\" ‚Üí Two couples: second couple finishes first ‚úÖ\n",
    "  - \"()() ‚Üí Two couples: each finishes in order ‚úÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Problem Scenarios (Invalid Cases):\n",
    "  - \"(\" ‚Üí Someone entered but never left ‚ùå\n",
    "  - \")\" ‚Üí Someone trying to leave but nobody entered ‚ùå\n",
    "  - \"(]\" ‚Üí Wrong person trying to leave ‚ùå\n",
    "  - \"({)\" ‚Üí Couples leaving in wrong order ‚ùå\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Stack is Perfect Here\n",
    "1. Natural Pairing:\n",
    "  - Stack remembers the order of \"waiting\" people\n",
    "  - Last person to enter must be first to exit (LIFO)\n",
    "  - Just like real couples in theater seats!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Easy Validation:\n",
    "  - Each exit must match most recent entry\n",
    "  - Stack top always has the next expected exit\n",
    "  - Empty stack at end = everyone left properly\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Extensions\n",
    "1. Multiple Types of Parentheses:\n",
    "  - '()', '[]', '{}' ‚Üí Like different theater sections\n",
    "  - Same rules apply: match with correct partner\n",
    "  - Stack keeps track of which type to match next\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quick Validations:\n",
    "  - If string length is odd ‚Üí Invalid!\n",
    "  - If first char is closing ‚Üí Invalid!\n",
    "  - If stack not empty at end ‚Üí Invalid!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Applications\n",
    "1. Code Editors:\n",
    "  - Matching brackets in programming\n",
    "  - Syntax validation\n",
    "  - Auto-completion features\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Math Expression Validators:\n",
    "  - Ensuring proper formula structure\n",
    "  - Calculator applications\n",
    "  - Mathematical expression parsers\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Beauty of Stack Solution\n",
    "- Simple yet powerful\n",
    "- Naturally matches the problem structure\n",
    "- O(n) time complexity - just one pass through!\n",
    "- Memory efficient - at most n/2 space needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like a theater needs order for couples entering and exiting, parentheses need proper order to be valid. The stack is our perfect usher, ensuring everyone finds their match! üé≠"
