    "# Next Greater Element in Circular Array: The Ferris Wheel Story ðŸŽ¡\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Ferris Wheel Analogy\n",
    "Imagine a circular Ferris wheel with people of different heights. You're sitting in a cabin and want to find the next taller person after you - but here's the twist - if there's no one taller ahead, you can continue looking from the start of the wheel!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Problem\n",
    "- Goal: For each person, find the next taller person (going clockwise)\n",
    "- If no taller person exists even after a full circle â†’ assign -1\n",
    "- The array is circular, so after last element, we check from beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Stack Magic Works\n",
    "1. The Basic Process:\n",
    "  - Stack keeps track of \"people still looking for their next taller person\"\n",
    "  - Smaller heights get pushed (they're waiting to find their next taller)\n",
    "  - Taller height arrives â†’ shorter people find their answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Circular Trick:\n",
    "  - First pass: Check immediate next greater\n",
    "  - Second pass: For those who didn't find in first round\n",
    "  - Like going around the Ferris wheel twice!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Visualization\n",
    "Consider heights: [5, 4, 3, 6, 2]\n",
    "- Round 1: Going around first time\n",
    " * 5 waits (pushed to stack)\n",
    " * 4 waits (pushed to stack)\n",
    " * 3 waits (pushed to stack)\n",
    " * 6 arrives! \n",
    "   - 3 finds its answer (6)\n",
    "   - 4 finds its answer (6)\n",
    "   - 5 finds its answer (6)\n",
    " * 2 waits (pushed to stack)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Round 2: Going around again for leftovers\n",
    " * 2 finds its answer (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Stack Works Beautifully Here\n",
    "1. Natural Height Tracking:\n",
    "  - Stack maintains potential candidates\n",
    "  - Taller elements naturally clear out shorter ones\n",
    "  - Perfect for \"next greater\" pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Power of Monotonic Stack:\n",
    "  - Stack maintains decreasing order\n",
    "  - When larger element comes â†’ smaller ones get their answer\n",
    "  - Like taller people being visible over shorter ones!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases & Handling\n",
    "1. No Greater Element:\n",
    "  - Even after two rounds â†’ assign -1\n",
    "  - Like going around the wheel twice but finding no one taller\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Same Heights:\n",
    "  - Treat like normal numbers\n",
    "  - Next occurrence of same height isn't considered greater\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Implementation Essence\n",
    "1. Double the Array (mentally):\n",
    "  - Think of going around twice\n",
    "  - Use modulo (%) to handle circular nature\n",
    "  - Like completing two full Ferris wheel rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Stack Maintenance:\n",
    "  - Keep heights that are waiting\n",
    "  - Pop when answer found\n",
    "  - Push new candidates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Approach is Clever\n",
    "- Handles circular nature elegantly\n",
    "- No need to actually double the array\n",
    "- O(n) time complexity despite circular property\n",
    "- Each element pushed/popped at most twice\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like a Ferris wheel that goes round and round, our circular array lets us look ahead and wrap around to find the next greater element! ðŸŽ¡"
