    "# Min Stack: The Library Book-Stack Story ðŸ“š\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Library Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you're a librarian with two special book stacks:\n",
    "- Main Stack: Your regular books (like normal stack operations)\n",
    "- Min Stack: A magical stack that always tells you the thinnest book so far!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Two-Stack Magic\n",
    "1. Main Stack (Regular Books):\n",
    "  - Just like normal library stack\n",
    "  - Books go in and out normally\n",
    "  - Each book has its thickness (value)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Min Stack (Thickness Tracker):\n",
    "  - Only updates when a thinner book arrives\n",
    "  - Always mirrors the minimum at each level\n",
    "  - Like keeping a \"thinnest book so far\" note at each level\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (Step by Step)\n",
    "1. When Adding a Book (Push):\n",
    "  Main Stack:\n",
    "  - Simply add the new book on top\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Min Stack:\n",
    "  - If empty â†’ push new book's thickness\n",
    "  - Compare new book with min stack's top\n",
    "  - Push whichever is thinner!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When Removing a Book (Pop):\n",
    "  - Remove from both stacks together\n",
    "  - They stay synchronized!\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Finding Minimum (getMin):\n",
    "  - Just peek at min stack's top\n",
    "  - That's it! No searching needed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Visualization\n",
    "Adding books with thickness: [3, 5, 2, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Add 3\n",
    "  Main Stack: [3]\n",
    "  Min Stack:  [3]  (First book, so it's minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Add 5\n",
    "  Main Stack: [3, 5]\n",
    "  Min Stack:  [3, 3]  (3 still thinnest)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Add 2\n",
    "  Main Stack: [3, 5, 2]\n",
    "  Min Stack:  [3, 3, 2]  (2 is new minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Add 1\n",
    "  Main Stack: [3, 5, 2, 1]\n",
    "  Min Stack:  [3, 3, 2, 1]  (1 is new minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Two Stacks Work Perfectly\n",
    "1. Time Efficiency:\n",
    "  - All operations O(1)\n",
    "  - No need to search for minimum\n",
    "  - Minimum always at min stack's top!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space Trade-off:\n",
    "  - Uses extra space for min stack\n",
    "  - Worth it for instant minimum access\n",
    "  - Like having a separate shelf for tracking!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Operations\n",
    "1. Push:\n",
    "  - Add to main stack normally\n",
    "  - Add minimum of (new value, min stack top) to min stack\n",
    "  - Like adding book and updating \"thinnest so far\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pop:\n",
    "  - Remove from both stacks\n",
    "  - Automatically maintains minimum property\n",
    "  - Like removing book and its thickness note\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GetMin:\n",
    "  - Just look at min stack's top\n",
    "  - Always accurate, always instant!\n",
    "  - Like checking the current \"thinnest book\" note\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clever Aspects\n",
    "1. Synchronization:\n",
    "  - Both stacks same height always\n",
    "  - Pop/Push happen together\n",
    "  - Perfect tracking at each level\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Historical Minimums:\n",
    "  - Min stack remembers all previous minimums\n",
    "  - Like keeping a history of \"thinnest book\" at each point\n",
    "  - When we pop, we return to previous minimum automatically!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like a library keeping track of both books and their thicknesses separately, our min stack uses two stacks to track values and their minimums! ðŸ“š"
