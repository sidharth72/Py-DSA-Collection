    "# Understanding Linked List Reversal: Theory and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linked List Reversal?\n",
    "Reversing a linked list means changing the direction of all pointers so that the last node becomes the first node (head) and the first node becomes the last node (tail). It's like taking a chain and flipping all the links to point in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept\n",
    "The fundamental idea involves manipulating three pointers:\n",
    "- `prev`: Points to the previous node\n",
    "- `curr`: Points to the current node being processed\n",
    "- `next`: Points to the next node in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial State\n",
    "```\n",
    "prev    curr    next\n",
    "NULL    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Save the Next Reference\n",
    "Before we change any pointers, we need to save where we're going next:\n",
    "```\n",
    "prev    curr    next\n",
    "NULL    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "        ↑   ↑\n",
    "        |   |\n",
    "       curr next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Reverse the Current Pointer\n",
    "Change current node's next pointer to point to previous node:\n",
    "```\n",
    "prev    curr    next\n",
    "NULL <- 1    2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "        ↑    ↑\n",
    "        |    |\n",
    "       curr  next\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Move Pointers One Step Forward\n",
    "Advance all pointers one position:\n",
    "```\n",
    "       prev  curr   next\n",
    "NULL <- 1    2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Repeat the Process\n",
    "After another iteration:\n",
    "```\n",
    "            prev  curr   next\n",
    "NULL <- 1 <- 2    3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final State\n",
    "After all iterations:\n",
    "```\n",
    "                        prev  curr\n",
    "NULL <- 1 <- 2 <- 3 <- 4    NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points to Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Three Pointers Rule**\n",
    "   - Always maintain three pointers (prev, curr, next)\n",
    "   - Never lose track of these references during reversal\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Before and After State**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Before: A -> B -> C -> D -> NULL\n",
    "   After:  NULL <- A <- B <- C <- D\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edge Cases**\n",
    "   - Empty list (NULL)\n",
    "   - Single node (A -> NULL)\n",
    "   - Two nodes (A -> B -> NULL)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Visualization Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Node Reversal\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before:     A -> NULL\n",
    "After:      A -> NULL\n",
    "(No change needed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Node Reversal\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before:     A -> B -> NULL\n",
    "After:      NULL <- A <- B\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Node Pattern\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1:     A -> B -> C -> NULL\n",
    "Step 2:     NULL <- A    B -> C -> NULL\n",
    "Step 3:     NULL <- A <- B    C -> NULL\n",
    "Step 4:     NULL <- A <- B <- C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory Pattern\n",
    "Think of the reversal process like \"forgetting where you're going but remembering where you came from\":\n",
    "1. Remember your next step (store next)\n",
    "2. Turn around (reverse pointer)\n",
    "3. Move forward (advance pointers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Memory Aid\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original Direction:\n",
    "[Head] → → → → → [Tail]\n",
    "\n",
    "During Reversal:\n",
    "[Old Head] ← ← ← ↑ → → [Old Tail]\n",
    "                 |\n",
    "              Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Direction:\n",
    "[New Tail] ← ← ← ← ← [New Head]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation occurs one node at a time, like a wave of reversal flowing through the list from left to right, while the pointers change from right to left."
