    "# Deleting Odd Numbers from a Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting odd numbers from a linked list involves traversing the list, identifying nodes with odd values, and removing them while maintaining the list's structure. This process requires careful pointer manipulation to ensure the list remains intact after deletions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this linked list:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> NULL\n",
    "After:\n",
    "2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with the head of the list.\n",
    "   - Use two pointers: 'current' and 'previous'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the list using 'current'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Odd Number Detection**:\n",
    "   - Check if the value in the current node is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deletion**:\n",
    "   - If odd, remove the node by adjusting pointers.\n",
    "   - If even, move to the next node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pointer Adjustment**:\n",
    "   - Update 'previous' and 'current' pointers accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the list is empty, return.\n",
    "2. While the head contains an odd value:\n",
    "   - Move head to the next node.\n",
    "   - Delete the old head.\n",
    "3. Set 'previous' to head and 'current' to head's next.\n",
    "4. While 'current' is not NULL:\n",
    "   - If 'current->data' is odd:\n",
    "     * Set 'previous->next' to 'current->next'.\n",
    "     * Delete 'current'.\n",
    "     * Set 'current' to 'previous->next'.\n",
    "   - Else:\n",
    "     * Move 'previous' to 'current'.\n",
    "     * Move 'current' to 'current->next'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Changes During Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "When an odd number is found:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "[2] -> [3] -> [4]\n",
    "^ ^ ^\n",
    "prev current next\n",
    "After:\n",
    "[2] --------> [4]\n",
    "^ ^\n",
    "prev current\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The node with the odd number is bypassed and then deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.\n",
    "  - We traverse the list once.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Empty list\n",
    "2. List with all odd numbers\n",
    "3. List with all even numbers\n",
    "4. Odd numbers at the beginning, middle, or end of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proper handling of node deletion to avoid memory leaks.\n",
    "- Careful pointer manipulation, especially when deleting the head node.\n",
    "- Handling the case where multiple consecutive odd numbers are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Method**: \n",
    "   - Recursively traverse the list.\n",
    "   - Delete odd numbers in the sublist.\n",
    "   - Return the modified list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Pass Approach**:\n",
    "   - First pass: Count total nodes and odd nodes.\n",
    "   - Second pass: Delete odd nodes.\n",
    "   - Useful if you need to know how many nodes will be deleted beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering out odd-numbered items from an inventory list.\n",
    "- Removing odd-numbered entries from a numerical dataset.\n",
    "- Cleaning up a list of player scores, keeping only even scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "function deleteOddNumbers(head):\n",
    "while head is not null and head.data is odd:\n",
    "temp = head\n",
    "head = head.next\n",
    "delete temp\n",
    "if head is null:\n",
    "return null\n",
    "prev = head\n",
    "current = head.next\n",
    "while current is not null:\n",
    "if current.data is odd:\n",
    "prev.next = current.next\n",
    "delete current\n",
    "current = prev.next\n",
    "else:\n",
    "prev = current\n",
    "current = current.next\n",
    "return head\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Losing List Continuity**: Incorrectly updating pointers can break the list.\n",
    "2. **Memory Leaks**: Failing to properly delete removed nodes.\n",
    "3. **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Not checking for null before accessing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Pointer Approach**: Use only one pointer by checking the next node's value.\n",
    "2. **Sentinel Node**: Add a dummy node at the beginning to simplify head node handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test with lists of various lengths (0, 1, even, odd number of nodes).\n",
    "2. Test with lists containing different patterns of odd and even numbers.\n",
    "3. Verify that the resulting list contains only even numbers.\n",
    "4. Check for memory leaks after deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting odd numbers from a linked list is a fundamental operation that combines traversal, condition checking, and careful pointer manipulation. It's an excellent exercise for understanding linked list operations and serves as a building block for more complex list manipulations. Mastering this operation provides insights into efficient data structure management and prepares one for handling more intricate linked list problems."
