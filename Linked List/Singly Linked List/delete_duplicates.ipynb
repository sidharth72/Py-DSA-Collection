    "# Deleting Duplicate Values from a Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting duplicate values from a linked list involves traversing the list, identifying duplicate values, and removing the redundant nodes while maintaining the list's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this linked list with duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After removing duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with the head of the list.\n",
    "   - Use two pointers: 'current' and 'runner'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outer Loop**:\n",
    "   - 'current' pointer iterates through each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inner Loop**:\n",
    "   - 'runner' pointer checks all subsequent nodes.\n",
    "   - Compares values with the 'current' node.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Duplicate Detection**:\n",
    "   - If a duplicate is found, remove it by adjusting pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pointer Advancement**:\n",
    "   - Move to the next unique node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the list is empty or has only one node, return.\n",
    "2. Set 'current' to the head of the list.\n",
    "3. While 'current' is not NULL:\n",
    "   a. Set 'runner' to 'current'.\n",
    "   b. While 'runner->next' is not NULL:\n",
    "      - If 'runner->next->data' equals 'current->data':\n",
    "        * Set 'temp' to 'runner->next'.\n",
    "        * Update 'runner->next' to 'runner->next->next'.\n",
    "        * Delete 'temp'.\n",
    "      - Else:\n",
    "        * Move 'runner' to 'runner->next'.\n",
    "   c. Move 'current' to 'current->next'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node Changes During Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "When a duplicate is found:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before:\n",
    "current -> [2] -> [2] -> [3]\n",
    "^ ^ ^\n",
    "current runner runner->next\n",
    "After:\n",
    "current -> [2] --------> [3]\n",
    "^ ^\n",
    "current runner->next\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The duplicate node is bypassed and then deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes.\n",
    "  - Outer loop runs n times.\n",
    "  - Inner loop can run up to n times for each outer loop iteration.\n",
    "- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorted List**: If the list is sorted, we can compare adjacent nodes, reducing time complexity to O(n).\n",
    "2. **Hash Table**: Use a hash table to track seen values, reducing time complexity to O(n) at the cost of O(n) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Empty list\n",
    "2. List with all duplicate values\n",
    "3. List with no duplicates\n",
    "4. Duplicates at the beginning, middle, or end of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Proper handling of node deletion to avoid memory leaks.\n",
    "- Careful pointer manipulation to maintain list integrity.\n",
    "- Handling of the head node if it's a duplicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursive Method**: \n",
    "   - Recursively traverse the list.\n",
    "   - Delete duplicates in the sublist.\n",
    "   - Compare current node with the next unique node.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Two-Pointer Technique** (for sorted lists):\n",
    "   - Use two pointers: one for the current node and one for the last unique node.\n",
    "   - Advance the second pointer until a different value is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing duplicate entries from a contact list.\n",
    "- Deduplicating a playlist in a music player.\n",
    "- Cleaning up redundant data in a log file stored as a linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Deleting duplicates from a linked list involves careful traversal and pointer manipulation. While the basic approach has a quadratic time complexity, optimizations can be applied based on the specific characteristics of the list or by using additional data structures. Understanding this process is crucial for efficient data management in various applications."
