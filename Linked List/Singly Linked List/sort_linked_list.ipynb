    "# Sorting a Linked List Using Selection Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of a list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. When using a linked list, we don’t have direct access to elements by index, so we must traverse the list using pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this explanation, we will use three pointers: \n",
    "1. **Current**: Points to the node that marks the start of the unsorted part of the list.\n",
    "2. **Runner**: Traverses through the remaining unsorted part of the list to find the minimum node.\n",
    "3. **Min**: Tracks the node with the smallest value in the unsorted part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Initialize Pointers\n",
    "- Start by setting the `current` pointer at the head of the linked list. This pointer will mark the boundary between the sorted and unsorted portions of the list.\n",
    "- Set the `runner` pointer to iterate over the unsorted portion to find the smallest element.\n",
    "- Initialize the `min` pointer to point to the `current` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "current -> [10] -> [3] -> [5] -> [8] -> [1] -> None  \n",
    "runner ---------------------^  \n",
    "min ----^\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Inner Loop to Find Minimum\n",
    "- Use the `runner` pointer to iterate through the unsorted part of the list.\n",
    "- If the `runner` points to a node with a value smaller than the `min` node, update the `min` pointer to that node.\n",
    "- After traversing the entire unsorted part, `min` will point to the smallest node.\n",
    "\n",
    "current -> [10] -> [3] -> [5] -> [8] -> [1] -> None  \n",
    "runner --------------------------^  \n",
    "min ----------------------------^\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Swap Data\n",
    "- Once the smallest node is found, swap its value with the value of the `current` node. This places the smallest element in its correct position in the sorted part of the list.\n",
    "- Then, move the `current` pointer to the next node, expanding the sorted portion of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "current -> [1] -> [3] -> [5] -> [8] -> [10] -> None  \n",
    "runner ---------------------^  \n",
    "min ----^ (Swap values)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Repeat the Process\n",
    "- Repeat the process: move `current` to the next node, reset `runner` to the next unsorted node, and repeat the process of finding the minimum and swapping.\n",
    "- For the next iteration, `current` moves to `3`, and `runner` scans the remaining list to find the next smallest value. If no smaller node is found, no swap is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "current -> [1] -> [3] -> [5] -> [8] -> [10] -> None  \n",
    "runner --------------^  \n",
    "min ----^ (Already in place)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Sorted List\n",
    "- Continue this process until the `current` pointer reaches the end of the list. At this point, the entire list will be sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] -> [3] -> [5] -> [8] -> [10] -> None\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(n²)**: For each node in the list (`current`), we traverse the remaining unsorted portion to find the minimum (`runner`). Hence, the time complexity is quadratic.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(1)**: Only a constant amount of extra space is used for the pointers (`current`, `runner`, and `min`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "1. `current` moves node by node, marking the boundary between sorted and unsorted parts.\n",
    "2. `runner` scans the unsorted part to find the minimum.\n",
    "3. `min` keeps track of the smallest node found.\n",
    "4. Swap the values of `current` and `min` to place the smallest value in the sorted part of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures an in-place sort of the linked list by rearranging node values without altering the structure of the nodes.\n"
