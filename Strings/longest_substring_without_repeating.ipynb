    "# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains no repeating characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "The problem requires tracking unique characters while dynamically adjusting our window size to maintain the \"no repeating characters\" condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach: Sliding Window\n",
    "The optimal solution uses the sliding window technique with these key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Window Boundaries**\n",
    "   - Left pointer (start): Marks the beginning of current substring\n",
    "   - Right pointer (end): Marks the end of current substring\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Character Tracking**\n",
    "   - Use a hash map/set to store characters in current window\n",
    "   - Key = character\n",
    "   - Value = most recent position of character\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Window Expansion\n",
    "- Start with empty window (left = right = 0)\n",
    "- Move right pointer forward, adding characters to set\n",
    "- Continue until duplicate found\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Window Contraction\n",
    "- When duplicate found, start removing characters from left\n",
    "- Move left pointer forward until duplicate is removed\n",
    "- Update max length if current window is longer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Key Operations\n",
    "- For each character:\n",
    "  * If character not in set: Add to window\n",
    "  * If character in set: Contract window until unique\n",
    "  * Track maximum length seen so far\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "- Single pass through string\n",
    "- Each character processed at most twice\n",
    "  * Once when added (right pointer)\n",
    "  * Once when removed (left pointer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity: O(min(m,n))\n",
    "- m = size of character set\n",
    "- n = length of string\n",
    "- Hash map/set never larger than unique characters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge Cases\n",
    "1. Empty string → Return 0\n",
    "2. Single character → Return 1\n",
    "3. All same characters → Return 1\n",
    "4. All unique characters → Return length of string\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Walkthrough\n",
    "String: \"abcabcbb\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial window: \"a\" → length 1\n",
    "2. Expand: \"abc\" → length 3\n",
    "3. Find 'a' again:\n",
    "   - Contract: remove 'a'\n",
    "   - New window: \"bca\" → length 3\n",
    "4. Continue process...\n",
    "5. Final answer: 3 (\"abc\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n",
    "1. Forgetting to update maximum length\n",
    "2. Incorrect window contraction\n",
    "3. Not handling edge cases\n",
    "4. Inefficient character lookup method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Tips\n",
    "1. Use integer array for ASCII characters instead of HashMap\n",
    "2. Pre-check string length for early returns\n",
    "3. Initialize data structures with appropriate size"
