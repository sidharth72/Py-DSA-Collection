    "\n",
    "Weighted graphs are powerful tools for modeling real-world systems where relationships have quantifiable attributes. They enable sophisticated analysis and optimization that simple unweighted graphs cannot provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: When relationships in your system have measurable \"costs\" or \"strengths,\" weighted graphs are your go-to data structure!\n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: Always consider the meaning and scale of your weights - they're not just numbers, they represent real-world quantities that affect your algorithm's behavior!"
