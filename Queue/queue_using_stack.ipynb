    "# Queue Using Stacks: The Airport Security Check Story ✈️\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Airport Security Analogy\n",
    "Imagine an airport with a unique security system:\n",
    "- Two security lines (our two stacks)\n",
    "- Main Line (Stack 1): Where people first enter\n",
    "- Transfer Line (Stack 2): Where people get reorganized\n",
    "Just like moving people through different security checkpoints to maintain order!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Two-Stack System\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack 1 (Main Line)\n",
    "- Where new passengers join\n",
    "- Like primary security line\n",
    "- Newest person at front (LIFO)\n",
    "- Used for enqueue operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack 2 (Transfer Line)\n",
    "- Where passengers get reordered\n",
    "- Like secondary security check\n",
    "- Helps maintain FIFO order\n",
    "- Used for dequeue operation\n",
    "\n",
    "## How The Magic Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Adding People (Enqueue)\n",
    "Simple Rule:\n",
    "- Always add to Stack 1\n",
    "- Like joining main security line\n",
    "- Quick and straightforward\n",
    "- O(1) operation - just one push!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Removing People (Dequeue)\n",
    "Clever Process:\n",
    "Step 1: If Stack 2 empty\n",
    "  - Move everyone from Stack 1 to Stack 2\n",
    "  - Like transferring whole line to second checkpoint\n",
    "  - Order gets reversed (exactly what we want!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Remove from Stack 2\n",
    "  - Take person from Stack 2 top\n",
    "  - They're now in correct order!\n",
    "  - First person who entered gets out first\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "Adding: 1, 2, 3, 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial State:\n",
    "Stack 1: [4, 3, 2, 1] (top to bottom)\n",
    "Stack 2: empty\n",
    "\n",
    "When Dequeue Needed:\n",
    "1. Transfer to Stack 2:\n",
    "  Stack 1: empty\n",
    "  Stack 2: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now can dequeue in order:\n",
    "  First out: 1\n",
    "  Then: 2\n",
    "  Then: 3\n",
    "  Then: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Works Beautifully\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Double Reversal Magic\n",
    "- Stack 1: Reverses original order\n",
    "- Transfer to Stack 2: Reverses again\n",
    "- Two reversals = original order!\n",
    "- Like going through two security checks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Efficiency Trade-offs\n",
    "Enqueue (Adding):\n",
    "- Always O(1)\n",
    "- Just push to Stack 1\n",
    "- Like joining main line\n",
    "\n",
    "Dequeue (Removing):\n",
    "- Amortized O(1)\n",
    "- Occasional O(n) when Stack 2 empty\n",
    "- Like bulk transfer between checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Cases Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Empty Queue\n",
    "Check:\n",
    "- Both stacks empty?\n",
    "- Like both security lines clear\n",
    "- Return error/null if trying to dequeue\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Single Element\n",
    "Simple Process:\n",
    "- Could be in either stack\n",
    "- Check Stack 2 first\n",
    "- Then Stack 1 if needed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clever Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Lazy Transfer\n",
    "- Only transfer when needed\n",
    "- Keep elements in Stack 2\n",
    "- Like keeping second line active\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Peek Operation\n",
    "- Always check Stack 2 first\n",
    "- Transfer if needed\n",
    "- Just like dequeue but no removal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. System Design\n",
    "- Task scheduling\n",
    "- Request queuing\n",
    "- Message processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Memory Efficient\n",
    "- Reuses existing stack structure\n",
    "- No need for circular array\n",
    "- Perfect for stack-based systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "1. Two stacks simulate queue perfectly\n",
    "2. Order maintained through transfers\n",
    "3. FIFO achieved through LIFO + LIFO\n",
    "4. Like security checkpoint system!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like airport security making sure everyone goes through in proper order, our two stacks work together to maintain perfect queue order! ✈️"
