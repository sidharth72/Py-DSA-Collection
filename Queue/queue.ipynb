    "# Queue: The Epic Train Station Story ðŸš‚\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Train Station Analogy\n",
    "Imagine you're at a train station where:\n",
    "- People enter through one gate (ENTRANCE)\n",
    "- Exit through another gate (EXIT)\n",
    "- Everyone must board in the order they arrived\n",
    "Just like a real train station, first person to arrive is first to board!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Concept: FIFO (First In, First Out)\n",
    "1. The Golden Rule:\n",
    "  - First person to arrive â†’ First person to board\n",
    "  - Just like British queues - perfectly ordered!\n",
    "  - No cutting in line, no special treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Queue Points:\n",
    "  - Front (HEAD) â†’ Where people board the train\n",
    "  - Rear (TAIL) â†’ Where new people join the line\n",
    "  - Like a real queue with fixed entry and exit points!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue Operations Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Enqueue (Joining the Line)\n",
    "- New passenger arrives at TAIL\n",
    "- Takes their spot at end of line\n",
    "- TAIL pointer moves one step forward\n",
    "- Like joining the back of train queue!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dequeue (Boarding the Train)\n",
    "- First passenger boards from HEAD\n",
    "- HEAD pointer moves to next person\n",
    "- Like when train arrives and first person steps in\n",
    "- Everyone moves one step forward!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Peek/Front\n",
    "- Looking at who's first in line\n",
    "- Just check HEAD (no removal)\n",
    "- Like checking who'll board next\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. IsEmpty\n",
    "- No passengers in line?\n",
    "- HEAD and TAIL point to same spot\n",
    "- Like checking if station's empty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Simple Queue\n",
    "- Basic straight line\n",
    "- One entrance, one exit\n",
    "- Like single platform queue\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Circular Queue\n",
    "- Like a revolving door\n",
    "- Last position connects to first\n",
    "- Space reuse after dequeue\n",
    "- Perfect for continuous operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Priority Queue\n",
    "- VIP line system\n",
    "- Higher priority boards first\n",
    "- Like having first-class passengers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Double-ended Queue (Deque)\n",
    "- Enter/Exit from both ends\n",
    "- Like a train with doors on both ends\n",
    "- More flexible than regular queue\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Queue Problems & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Queue Overflow\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- Line gets too long\n",
    "- No more space to add people\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Use dynamic sizing\n",
    "- Like opening new waiting areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Queue Underflow\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- Trying to dequeue empty queue\n",
    "- No one in line but train arrives\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "- Always check if queue empty\n",
    "- Like checking platform before calling next\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-world Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Computer Systems\n",
    "- Print job queues\n",
    "- Process scheduling\n",
    "- Network packet queuing\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Daily Life\n",
    "- Ticket counters\n",
    "- Restaurant orders\n",
    "- Customer service\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Programming\n",
    "- BFS algorithms\n",
    "- Task scheduling\n",
    "- Message queues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Array Implementation\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Fixed size (like platform capacity)\n",
    "- Easy indexing\n",
    "- Good for small queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Size limitation\n",
    "- Wastage after dequeue\n",
    "- Like having empty platform space\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Linked List Implementation\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "- Dynamic size\n",
    "- No space wastage\n",
    "- Like having expandable platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "- Extra memory for links\n",
    "- No random access\n",
    "- Like having to walk through whole line\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue Efficiency\n",
    "1. Time Complexity:\n",
    "  - Enqueue: O(1)\n",
    "  - Dequeue: O(1)\n",
    "  - Peek: O(1)\n",
    "  Like instant decisions at station!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Space Complexity:\n",
    "  - O(n) where n is queue size\n",
    "  - Like space needed for n passengers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Queue Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Circular Queue Benefits\n",
    "- Space reuse\n",
    "- No shifting needed\n",
    "- Like a continuous loop of passengers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Priority Rules\n",
    "- Multiple priority levels\n",
    "- Efficient ordering\n",
    "- Like having multiple service classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like a well-managed train station, a queue maintains perfect order and fairness. Everyone gets their turn, exactly when they should! ðŸš‰"
