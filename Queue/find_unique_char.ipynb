    "# Finding First Unique Character: The Theme Park Ride Story ðŸŽ¡\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Theme Park Analogy\n",
    "Imagine a special ride where:\n",
    "- People line up (that's our Queue!)\n",
    "- Each person wears a colored shirt\n",
    "- We need to find the first person wearing a unique colored shirt\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (Two-Pass Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Pass: Count Colors (Frequency Map)\n",
    "- Walk past the line\n",
    "- Count how many people wear each color\n",
    "- Like taking attendance of shirt colors!\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "String \"leetcode\"\n",
    "l: 1, e: 3, t: 1, c: 1, o: 1, d: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Pass: Find First Unique\n",
    "- Check each person in order\n",
    "- Look up their shirt color count\n",
    "- First person with count 1 is our answer!\n",
    "- Just like finding first person with unique shirt\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue's Role\n",
    "- Maintains original order of characters\n",
    "- Perfect for \"first occurrence\" problems\n",
    "- Like keeping track of who came first!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Example\n",
    "Input: \"leetcode\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count Phase:\n",
    "  - Count all characters\n",
    "  - Store in frequency map\n",
    "  - Like taking color inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find Phase:\n",
    "  - Start from beginning\n",
    "  - Check each character's count\n",
    "  - Find first with count 1\n",
    "  - Answer: 'l' (first character with count 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Queue is Perfect Here\n",
    "1. Maintains Order:\n",
    "  - Original sequence preserved\n",
    "  - First occurrence stays first\n",
    "  - Like keeping line order intact\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficient Access:\n",
    "  - O(1) to check next character\n",
    "  - Like checking next person in line\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Just like finding the first person with a unique shirt color in a theme park line, we use a queue to track the original order while finding our unique character! ðŸŽ¡"
